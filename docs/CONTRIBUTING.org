  First thing's first: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

* Notice

  This file is a WIP! Feel free to make a pull request and a maintainer will reply shortly. The only thing to note is
  that all pull requests should be made from a branch and not directly from a fork's master to our master branch (this
  makes rebasing easier for maintainers).

  Thanks for understanding and contributing!
